          <h3>Vaasavi</h3>
          In her time at Carnegie Mellon, Vaasavi has always wanted to make
          student's lives better. After working with administration on the
          University Strategic Plan, she realized that students were missing a
          vital part of their Carnegie Mellon Experience: the infrastructure to
          be innovators and leaders outside of the classroom. Since then, she
          has worked to create environments encouraging students to think of
          ways to change campus for the better. In her work as CA of E Tower,
          she created a thinly-veiled incentive structure for students to engage
          with the outside community. She wants to bring this to the overall CMU
          community to make permanent improvements to campus.

        <div class="block block-half">
          <h3>Aaron</h3>
          When Aaron first came to Carnegie Mellon, he took up as many
          opportunities to try new things and engage with the campus as
          possible. He felt that he grew and learned far more outside the
          classroom. Not everyone takes that same path. More than anything else,
          students are forced to prioritize at Carnegie Mellon, and that is the
          cause of a lot of stress. But students should not have to make that
          choice. Engaging and exploration with the campus outside the classroom
          should be an integral part of the Carnegie Mellon experience.

      <h2 id="platform">How we will help</h2>

      <div class="clearfix">
        <div class="block block-third">
          <img src="icon0.png">
          <h3>Fiscal Transparency</h3>
          As students, we deserve to know where our tuition is going, how our
          administrators are getting paid and about the university's spending.
          Aaron and Vaasavi have read CMU's tax forms, so you don't have to.
          Additionally, we are constantly asked for donations, yet it's not
          always clear where that money is used. Look out for infographics on
          our Facebook page! #financefridays

          <img src="icon1.png">
          <h3>The Model for Social Change</h3>
          If we're going to change the world, we might as well get started. We
          call it the President's Initiative--the common thread of the CMU
          experience that we have the power to change. Vaasavi and Aaron
          propose to mobilize club presidents around a common issue, and reward
          the clubs and organizations that provide innovative cultural
          solutions on our campus.
        </div>
        <div class="block block-third">
          <img src="icon2.png">
          <h3>Student Government Transparency</h3>
          It shouldn't be normal that no one knows what Student Government
          Executives do. The Student Body President should make an effort to be
          present and available to all students, and regularly inform the
          student body on what they're up to. Vaasavi and Aaron propose making
          all student organization transactions public, a weekly column in the
          Tartan, and going beyond the constitutionally required SBP office
          hours in highly trafficked areas of campus, so there are no barriers
          to being informed.

          <h3>Olivia Roy - Chief of Staff</h3>

          I've known Aaron since we were freshmen in E-Tower. We and our
          friends would sit on the floor of his room and talk about how we had
          grown since high school. As introspective as those
          conversations are, I don't want to just talk anymore, I want to do
          something. Vaasavi has a compelling call to action, and the
          leadership qualities that we need in a Student Body President.  I'm
          proud to support Vaas and Aaron because they don't just want to talk
          about how CMU has changed us, but how we can change CMU.

          <h3>Zach Newman - Recruitment</h3>
          I support Vaasavi because from our first meeting, I knew how much
          passion she has for this school and how much she is able to make
          positive change. After conversations with her about deep rooted
          issues we face as students, I realized the importance to have a leader
          who understands so many different cultures within the student body to
          make our four years at Carnegie Mellon more meaningful, impactful,
          and positive. Despite her humility, I fully believe Vaasavi fits that
          role and I am proud to be a part of her campaign.

          <h3>Srishti Jain - Public Relations</h3>

          I'm tired of merely talking about social change, and am ready for
          students at Carnegie Mellon to actually make change. I believe Vaasavi
          and Aaron are the best candidates to facilitate these changes. With
          their experience, ambition, and thoughtfulness, I know they have the
          ability to improve the lives of the CMU student body. After witnessing
          Vaasavi and Aaron in Student Senate for the past few years, I can
          confidently say Vaasavi and Aaron will be meaningful and transparent
          with their initiatives.

          <h3>Bettina Chou - Designer</h3>
          The CMU design curriculum has instilled upon me a habit of looking at
          problems as systems on various scales and looking for entry points to
          resolve certain problem spaces. So, hearing Vaasavi's approach, I was
          pleasantly surprised to learn the methods in econ/finance tackled
          issues in a similar, yet more empirical way. Combined with her
          intrinsic compassion and empathy, I am confident in her
          solution-oriented mindset. I support her and Aaron because I believe
          they will create effective solutions with a purpose as opposed to
          temporary band-aid solutions.
